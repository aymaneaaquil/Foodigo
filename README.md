issues:

All my issues are on the products pages, on the phone the cart icon doesn't show in the nav toggler. (it is here but its just invisible for some reason. You can click on it to access it.). It does show normally on the nav bar on the computer version.
Another issue I have on the products pages, is the product pictures. On the computer size the layout is perfect but on the mobile sizes the picture is cropped from the left a little bit and isn't alined perfectly.
